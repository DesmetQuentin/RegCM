As one of the main aims of the \ac{ICTP} is to foster the growth of advanced studies and research in developing countries, the main purpose of this Regional Climate Model (\ac{RegCM}) Tutorial Class Notes is to give model users a guide to learn the whole \ac{RegCM} Model System.
         
The RegCM Tutorial Class is offered as a part of extended hands-on lab sessions during a series of Workshops organized by the \ac{PWC} group at the \ac{ICTP}. 

\ac{RegCM} was originally developed at the \ac{NCAR} and has been mostly applied to studies of regional climate and seasonal predictability around the world. The workshop participants are welcome to use 
\ac{RegCM} for regional climate simulation over different areas of interest. The \ac{RegCM} is available on the World Wide Web at {\bf http://www.ictp.trieste.it/$\sim$pubregcm/RegCM3}. \\
