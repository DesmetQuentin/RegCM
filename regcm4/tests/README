Minimal regression test  suite for REGCM code
Each subdirectory contains a full regression test that can be run with both regcm4 and regcm3 versions
 
Directory tree:
 /regression_tests 
         clean.sh : script to clean and prepare the environment to execute the benchmarks. 
                    it should be executed in the RUN directory of each benchmark 
         regcm_compile.sh : script to compile regcm code using appropriate regcm.param/param2 files
                    it should be executed in the main directory of each benchmarks (for regcm3 code) 
 /regression_tests/NAME_OF_the_BENCHMARK 
         regcm.param  : parameter file for serial regcm3 compilation 
 	 regcm2.param : parameter file for parallel regcm3 compilation
         parameter.inc : parameter fiel for Regcm4 compilation 
         domain.param :  to produce the Input file from scratch 
         README: information about the benchmarks 
	 Run: directory where to Run the code
              it contains two input files for regcm:
			regcm.in-one-day regcm.in-one-month and symbolic links to input data file contained
              in input directory.  
         Input: directory where to place input files (DOMAIN and ICBC and all the rest) 
         Results: directory containing standard output results to compare with  

Please note: Input files, due to their sizes, are separately stored on Regcm gforge web page as tar.gz file.
             once downloaded please just execute 
	     tar -xvzf benchmarks_input.tgz 
             and all the files will be placed in the right directories
