This little program performs some of the processing done by the former
postproc program in V3.

What it does:

        * Transform output (not ICBC) to NetCDF CF-1.4 convention compliant
          files (except for CHEM, which is mostly but not all compliant in
          terms of variables standard_name).
        * Keep inside output files information about run parameters and
          schemes
        * Allow plotting using CF convention aware tools
        * Allow operations using operators like CDO or NCO

Notably it does not:

        * Display data (left to tools like Unidata IDV or NASA panoply)
        * Perform time means (left to NCO or CDO)
        * Perform pressure level interpolation

Using this program should (hopefully) be straightforward. It does expect You
are running or have completed to run a RegCM V4 simulation in a directory
somewhere on Your machine with a standard file layout. It does require for this
just two mandatory arguments:

    regcm.in  - path to regcm.in of RegCM model v4
    expname   - a (meaningful) name for this expertiment

Example:

     ./rcm2netcdf [options] /home/regcm/Run/regcm.in ACWA_reference

It does assume in this case that:

   -) The output directory of the model is '/home/regcm/Run/output'
   -) All output files You want to process are inside this dir
   -) The regcm.in file is relative to those files
   -) In case of subgridding, the fort.11 link is present in '/home/regcm/Run'

Some useful options are provided:

   --sequential              : Set I/O non direct (direct access default)
   --little_endian           : Set I/O endianess to LITTLE (BIG default)
   --onlyatm/-a              : Process ATM file (default do all)
   --onlysrf/-s              : Process SRF file (default do all)
   --onlysub/-u              : Process SUB file (default do all)
   --onlyrad/-r              : Process RAD file (default do all)
   --onlyche/-c              : Process CHE file (default do all)
   --startstep/-t [number]   : Start at timestep number 'number'
   --nsteps/-n [number]      : Process just 'number' timesteps
   --help/-h                 : Print help
   --version/-V              : Print versioning information
