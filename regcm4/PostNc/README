This little program performs some of the processing done by the former
postproc program in V3.

What it does:

        * Transform output to NetCDF CF-1.4 convention compliant
          files (except for CHEM, which is mostly but not all compliant in
          terms of variables standard_name).
        * Keep inside output files information about run parameters and
          schemes
        * Allow plotting using CF convention aware tools
        * Allow operations using operators like CDO or NCO

Notably it does not:

        * Display data (left to tools like Unidata IDV or NASA panoply)
        * Perform time means (left to NCO or CDO)
        * Perform pressure level interpolation

Using this program should (hopefully) be straightforward. It does expect You
are running or have completed to run a RegCM V4 simulation with its
associated namelist file. It is the only mandatory argument to give to the
programs in current directory:

    regcm.in  - path to regcm.in of RegCM model v4

Example:

     ./rcm2netcdf [options] /home/regcm/Run/regcm.in

It does assume in this case that the regcm.in file contains the correct
parameters used for the model run.

Some useful options are provided:

   --sequential                 : Set sequential (direct access default)
   --little_endian              : Set endianess to LITTLE (BIG default)
   --grads                      : Produce a CTL file for GrADS
   --list/-l                    : Output list of names for -v option
   --var/-v[all|name[,name]]    : Include only some vars (all default)
   --tstart/-t YYYY[MM[DD[HH]]] : Start processing at this date
   --tend/-e YYYY[MM[DD[HH]]]   : Stop processing at this date
   --onlyatm/-a                 : Process ATM file (default do all)
   --onlysrf/-s                 : Process SRF file (default do all)
   --onlysub/-u                 : Process SUB file (default do all)
   --onlyrad/-r                 : Process RAD file (default do all)
   --onlyche/-c                 : Process CHE file (default do all)
   --help/-h                    : Print this help
   --version/-V                 : Print versioning information

Some examples:

1) PostProcess model output for ATM only file to obtain just soil water content
   and ground temperature for the period 1 January 1989 to 31 March 1989

   rcm2netcdf -a -v swt,tgb -t 198901 -e 1989033100 myregcm.in

2) PostProcess model output for SRF and RAD to obtain 2m temperature from SRF
   and absorbed solar flux from RAD for just january 1989.

   rcm2netcdf -s -r -v t2,frs -t 198901 -e 1989013118 myregcm.in

The other two programs, icbc2netcdf and dom2netcdf, will process just DOMAIN
and ICBC data, and have only a subset of the rcm2netcdf options.

1) Obtain my DOMAIN data in netcdf

   dom2netcdf myregcm.in

2) Obtain used ICBC data in NetCDF for the half January - half February
   period along with a CTL file for GrADS

   icbc2netcdf -t 19890115 -e 19890215 --grads myregcm.in

Note that the GrADS program, albeit being widely used, misses lot of features
more complete data analysis and visualization tools have. Mostly:

  -) It does support only regular lat/lon data or simple projections (not all
     RegCM earth projections are supported)
  -) It does allow only a single "Z" dimension, and a dataset with say vertical
     atmospheric levels together with soil levels is not represented.

A warning is issued by programs when a data present in the NetCDF data cannot
be viewed with GrADS or require additional processing.
