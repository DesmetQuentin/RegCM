# NetCDF library:
# The NetCDF library is needed to run RegCM, 
# RegCM V4 was successfuly tested with NetCDF 4.0.1

# In NETCDFLIB you should define the path and the name of the NetCDF library

# parallel version : uncomment the line

# PARALLEL = MPP1

# Add further preprocessor flags, if necessary. Those available are:
# -DIBM : to compile using IBM xlf compiler
# -DNETCDF4_HDF5 : to use new NetCDF 4.x HDF5 format with compression
# Note, the latter needs to be enabled in NetCDF installation
