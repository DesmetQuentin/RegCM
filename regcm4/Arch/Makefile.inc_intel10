# This a a template file that  contains all variables to be included in all other Makefiles
# This file is commented in detail to help you fine tune your RegCM distribution

# GENERAL FLAGS: these should be always defined!  

# Base directory:

# DATA directories: 
REGCM_DATA_DIR = /scratch/mydatadir

# NetCDF library:
# The NetCDF library is needed to run RegCM, 
# RegCM V4 was successfuly tested with NetCDF 4.0.1
# In NETCDFINC you should define the path to NetCDF include files
# In NETCDFLIB you should define the path and the name of the NetCDF library

# PREPROCESSOR AND COMPILER OPTIONS

# Use this variable to enable the parallel version of the code
# serial version : PARALLEL = ""
# parallel version : PARALLEL = "MPP1"

# Add further preprocessor flags, if necessary. Those available are:
# -DIBM : to compile using IBM xlf compiler
# -DDIAG : to compile enabling Diagnostic capabilities (?)

# Specific compiler flags (eg.: optimization / debugging) 
# IMPORTANT : Check that your compiler complies with this RegCM features:
# - RegCM expects the output to be written in big endian format
# - RegCM expects Fortran records to be measured in bytes
