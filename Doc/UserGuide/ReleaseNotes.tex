RegCM-4.1 is a new step in recoding the RegCM3 model after the effort put into
the RegCM4.0 version. The code base now is actively developed by a community
of developers internal and external to ICTP, and this work is merged on the
eforge site on e-science-lab.org site.

The main new technical features of the code are summarized in the following
points

\begin{itemize}
\item Dynamic memory allocation
\item F95 programming language
\item Module approach
\item Unique makefile for the whole code from pre-processing to post-processing
\item NetCDF I/O format from model components following the CF-1.4 standard
\end{itemize}
