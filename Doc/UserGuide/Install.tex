In order to configure and install the RegCM code, the following software are
needed:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Python 2 language interpreter
\item GNU Make program
\item Fortran 90 compiler
\item NetCDF Format I/O library compiled with the above compiler.
   Source code can be found from \\
{\bf ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/netcdf.tar.gz} \\
Note that current version 4.1.2 is dependent on HDF5 1.8.6.
\end{enumerate}

Optional requirements strongly suggested are :

\begin{enumerate}
\item MPI2 Message Passing Library compiled with the above fortran compiler
for parallel runs using multiple core single machines or cluster of machines.
Source code for the implementation code was tested with can be obtained at: \\
{\bf http://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v1.4/downloads}
\item HDF5 Format I/O Library compiled with the above fortran compiler to
enable NetCDF V4 features. Source code can be obtained at: \\
{\bf http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/current/src}
\item NCO NetCDF Operators for manging NetCDF file. Most Linux distribution
have this already packed, and You should refer to Your System Administrator or
OS Software Installation manual to obtain it. Source code is at: \\
{\bf http://nco.sourceforge.net/src}
\item CDO Climatic data Operators for managing NetCDF file. Most Linux
distribution have this already packed, and You should refer to Your System
Administrator or OS Software Installation manual to obtain it.
Source code is at: \\
{\bf https://code.zmaw.de/projects/cdo/files}
\item A Scientific Plotting and Data Analysis Software such as:
\begin{itemize}
\item GrADS 2.0 Graphical Analysis and Display System. Convenient helpers
are packed in RegCM to use GrADS with RegCM NetCDF output files.
Binaries and source code can be obtained from \\
{\bf http://www.iges.org/grads/downloads.html}
\item NCL, NCAR Command Language. The NCL can read NetCDF output files, and
sample scripts can be found in the {\em Tools/Scripts/NCL} directory.
Binaries and source code can be obtained from \\
{\bf http://www.ncl.ucar.edu}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

The RegCM Version 4.1 is configured by a python2 script, which will select
and edit for You sample configuration files for the supported architectures.
