Source code can be obtained via svn ( preferred method).
Check that {\bf Subversion} suftware is installed on Your machine typing
the following command:

\begin{verbatim}
svn --version
\end{verbatim}

If Your system answers \verb=command not found=, refer to Your System
Administrator or software installation manual of Your OS to install the
subversion software. To be just an example, on Scientific Linux the command
to install it as root is:

\begin{verbatim}
yum install subversion
\end{verbatim}

If Subversion is installed, just type the following command:

\begin{verbatim}
svn checkout https://eforge.escience-lab.org/svn/regcm/tags/RegCM-4.1
\end{verbatim}

If svn software is not present a tar.gz file can be downloaded from

http://eforge.escience-lab.org/gf/project/regcm/frs/

The RegCM team strongly encourage the users to use the svn software to have
always the possibility to be up to date and to check on-line all the news of
the package.
