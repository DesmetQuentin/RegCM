A packed archive file with the model code can be downloaded from:

\begin{Verbatim}
http://eforge.escience-lab.org/gf/project/regcm/frs/RegCM-4.1.tar.gz
\end{Verbatim}

and it can be later on decompressed and unpacked using:

\begin{Verbatim}
$> tar -zxvf RegCM-4.1.tar.gz
\end{Verbatim}

If you plan to become a model developer, source code can be obtained via svn.
The RegCM team strongly encourage the contributing developers to enroll on
the eforge site to always be up to date and to check on-line all the news of
the package.

Check that {\bf Subversion} suftware is installed on your machine typing
the following command:

\begin{verbatim}
$> svn --version
\end{verbatim}

If your system answers \verb=command not found=, refer to your System
Administrator or software installation manual of your OS to install the
subversion software. To be just an example, on Scientific Linux the command
to install it as root is:

\begin{verbatim}
#> yum install subversion
\end{verbatim}

If Subversion is installed, just type the following command:

\begin{verbatim}
$> svn checkout https://eforge.escience-lab.org/svn/regcm/tags/RegCM-4.1
\end{verbatim}

Whatever method is chosen to download the code, we assume that you have now
on your working directory a new directory, named \verb=RegCM-4.1=.
That directory will be for the rest of this guide referred as 
\verb=$REGCM_ROOT= .

All the operations to build the model binaries will be performed in this
directory.
