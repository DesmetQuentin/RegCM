\begin{abstract}

As one of the main aims of the \ac{ICTP} is to foster the growth of advanced
studies and research in developing countries, the main purpose of this Regional
Climate Model (\ac{RegCM}) Tutorial Class Notes is to give model users a guide
to learn the whole \ac{RegCM} Model System.
         
The RegCM Tutorial Class is offered as a part of extended hands-on lab sessions
during a series of Workshops organized by the \ac{PWC} group at the \ac{ICTP}. 

\ac{RegCM} was originally developed at the \ac{NCAR} and has been mostly
applied to studies of regional climate and seasonal predictability around the
world.  The workshop participants are welcome to use \ac{RegCM} for regional
climate simulation over different areas of interest. The \ac{RegCM} is
available on the World Wide Web at {\bf
https://eforge.escience-lab.org/gf/project/regcm/wiki/}.
